# Team

## Meet the Founder

Hello! My name is <a href="https://linktr.ee/sequierh" target="_blank">Hugo SEQUIER</a>, a 23-year-old French student based in Paris. I am currently working as a Data Scientist apprentice in the construction industry. My passion for new technologies drives me to contribute to the ongoing revolution within this ever-evolving ecosystem.

## About Trophē

I am the sole contributor to the Trophē project, dedicating my time and efforts to bring my vision to life. As I continue to make significant progress towards my goals, I plan to expand the team. Once the project reaches a more advanced stage, I will be seeking passionate and skilled individuals to join me. This will help to accelerate our progress and ensure that Trophē evolves into a robust and innovative platform.

## My Journey

In 2021, I discovered cryptocurrencies from a builder's perspective, learning to use Solidity for smart contract development. However, I decided to refocus on my studies and the themes of AI to develop my skills and specialize in this field. I revisited blockchain technology in November 2023, adding a financial perspective to my understanding.

Since April 2024, I have been working on the Trophē project, merging my expertise in AI and blockchain to create innovative solutions. My enthusiasm for technology extends beyond AI and data science. I have a strong interest in blockchain technology, which I believe has immense potential to transform various sectors. Blockchain goes beyond cryptocurrencies; it offers robust solutions for securing transactions, ensuring data traceability, and creating decentralized computing networks, among other applications.

## Vision and Goals

I aim to democratize access to advanced technologies and redefine how individuals and businesses interact with these powerful tools. Alongside my professional work, I am pursuing studies in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, equipping myself to lead innovative and ambitious projects in the future.
