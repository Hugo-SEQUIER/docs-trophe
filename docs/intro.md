# Trophē Documentation

Welcome to the Trophē Documentation! This comprehensive guide is designed to provide you with all the information you need to understand and utilize our solution effectively. The documentation is divided into two main parts:

1. **Project Overview**: 
   This section introduces you to Trophē, explaining its purpose, key features, and the problems it aims to solve. It provides a high-level understanding of the project, its goals, and how it can benefit users.

2. **Technical Documentation**:
   The second part is a detailed, technical guide on how to use Trophē. It includes step-by-step instructions, code examples, and best practices for implementing and integrating our solution into your projects. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or technical user, this section will help you make the most of Trophē's capabilities.

We recommend starting with the Project Overview to gain a solid understanding of Trophē before diving into the technical details. Let's begin exploring Trophē and how it can enhance your workflow!


## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
